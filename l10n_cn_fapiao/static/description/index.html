"Fapiao" is an official invoice in China, printed with a separate official
software. This module allows the users to manage all emitted and received
"fapiao" as object in Odoo. A new submenu called Fapiao is added under the
menu Accounting.
	       
The procedure to follow for the fapiao management is as below:<br>
<ol>
	<li>1: A fapiao is received or emitted</li>
	<li>2: The document can be scanned as image</li>
	<li>3: A new fapiao is created in Odoo</li>
	<li>4: The scanned document is uploaded to the newly created object as attachment.</li>
	<li>5: Fapiao allocation to invoice: Fapiao and Odoo invoices can be linked to each other</li>
</ol>
