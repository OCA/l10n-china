=========================
Chinese Fapiao Management
=========================

"Fapiao" is an official invoice in China, printed with a separate official
software. This module allows the users to manage all emitted and received
"fapiao" as object in Odoo. A new submenu called Fapiao is added under the
menu Accounting.

Usage
=====

The procedure to follow for the fapiao management is as below:

#. A fapiao is received or emitted.
#. The document can be scanned as image.
#. A new fapiao is created in Odoo.
#. The scanned document is uploaded to the newly created object as attachment.
#. Fapiao allocation to invoice: Fapiao and Odoo invoices can be
  linked to each other.
